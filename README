GeoTiler is a library to create maps using tiles from a map provider.

The code is based on Python port of Modest Maps project [1][2], which is
licensed under BSD license. All subsequent changes are licensed under GPL
v3 license.

The main goal of the library is to enable a programmer to create maps
using tiles downloaded from a map provider like OpenStreetMap or Stamen.

The maps can be used by interactive applications or to create data analysis
graphs.
